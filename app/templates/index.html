		<p class="bio-paragraph">When I graduated in Environmental Engineering, my goal was to work with technologies that promote positive
			changes in the world. Although I changed my profession, this motivation stayed the same.</p>
		<p class="bio-paragraph">I spent time researching and practicing in the fields of Interaction Design and User Experience (UX), and my
			focus is placed on the creation of products that efficiently solve problems in people's lives.
			 In other words, products with clear features and purposes that are sufficiently easy to be used and deliver a good experience.</p>
		<p class="bio-paragraph">I also developed skills in the fields of visual identity for companies and professionals, implementation
			of websites and communication of technical and complex subjects through the creation of explanatory infographics
			adapted to very different audiences.</p>
